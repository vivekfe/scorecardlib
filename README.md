# What is this Library

You are working in a sports data company, and we would like you to develop a new Live Football ##World Cup Scoreboard library (or frontend application) that shows all the ongoing matches and their ##scores.

### The scoreboard supports the following operations:

1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
  a. Home team
  b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away team score.

3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.

4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.
